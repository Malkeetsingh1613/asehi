## Time complexities for dot product using various different methods..

| Version   | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Description                           |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Version 1 | O(n)            | O(1)             | Simple dot-product calculation        |
| Version 2 | O(n log n)      | O(n)             | Optimized using dynamic programming  |
| Version 3 | O(n)            | O(n)             | Parallelized version using numpy     |


<p>The dot product of two vectors <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> is Mathematically calculated as:</p>
<p><b>A</b> &middot; <b>B</b> = <i>&sum;</i><sub>i=1</sub><sup>n</sup> <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> &middot; <b>B<sub>i</sub></b></p>"# MSK1613"
